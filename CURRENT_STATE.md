# Current State (Single Source of Truth)

Day: 2.5
Phase: Linux Foundations (Admin/Workflow)

Environment:
- Host OS: macOS
- Linux VM: Ubuntu Server (VirtualBox)
- VM IP: 192.168.X.X
- SSH Host Alias: ubuntu-lab
- Primary User: prkr
- Repo Path: /Users/prkr/cloud-labs/cloud-engineer-60d
- Git Branch: main

Completed:
- Day 1: VM setup, SSH, VS Code Remote
- Day 2: Filesystem navigation basics
- Day 2.5: Repo workflow + runbooks (WORKFLOW.md), templates, Git pull/push resolved

In Progress:
- (leave blank or add 1 bullet if something is half-done)

Next Exact Step:
- Start Day 3 (planned) from MASTER_PLAN.md
- Create `labs/day03/...` (or whatever Day 3 says) and complete the first Day 3 exercises

Notes / Gotchas:
- Edit repo docs on Mac (VS Code), not inside SSH unless repo is cloned to Ubuntu.
- GitHub updates only after add/commit/push.
