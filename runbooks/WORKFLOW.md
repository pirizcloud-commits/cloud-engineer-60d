# Workflow: How I Run the 60-Day Project (Start + End)

This repo uses three key files:
- MASTER_PLAN.md = the roadmap (what each day covers)
- CURRENT_STATE.md = the save file (where I am right now)
- notes/dayXX.md = daily evidence + learnings

---

## Start of Day (Load the Save) — 5–10 minutes

1) Start the Ubuntu VM (VirtualBox) and wait until it finishes booting.

2) Open Mac Terminal and sync the repo:
```bash
cd ~/cloud-labs/cloud-engineer-60d
git pull
git status
