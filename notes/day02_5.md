# Day 2.5 — Admin / Repo Workflow Setup (Catch-up Day)

## Objective
- Build a reliable system so I can pause and resume the 60-day project without losing context.

## What I did today (high level)
- Created/updated runbooks and templates to standardize start-of-day and end-of-day.
- Fixed Git pull/push issues (divergent branches / merge prompt).
- Confirmed repo structure and where to edit files (Mac vs SSH/Ubuntu).
- Set up WORKFLOW.md as the single source of truth.

## What I learned
- GitHub only updates after: git add → git commit → git push.
- “Everything up-to-date” means I didn’t commit anything new.
- If I’m SSH’d into ubuntu-lab, editing files there might not affect my Mac repo.
- CURRENT_STATE.md is my “save file.”

## Receipts / Proof (optional)
- (Paste any important terminal outputs or short notes here)

## Next Step
- Resume Day 3 (planned activities) using MASTER_PLAN.md and CURRENT_STATE.md “Next Exact Step”.
