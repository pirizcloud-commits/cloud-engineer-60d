# Day 02 — Filesystem Navigation + Mental Mapping

## Goal
Learn how to move around the Linux filesystem confidently using paths and basic navigation commands.

## What I learned
- A path is like an address for a file or folder.
- Absolute paths start at the root `/` (the top of everything).
- Relative paths start from where I currently am.
- `~` means “my home folder.”
- `..` means “go up one folder.”
- `.` means “this folder.”

## Commands I used (with examples)
- pwd (print working directory)
  Example: pwd
- ls (list files)
  Example: ls
  Example: ls -lah
- cd (change directory)
  Example: cd ~
  Example: cd ..
  Example: cd -
- mkdir -p (make folders)
  Example: mkdir -p labs/day02/{logs,scripts,configs}
- tree (show folder structure as a tree, if installed)
  Example: tree labs/day02

## What I broke / got wrong
- (Write what confused you or what you typed wrong.)

## How I fixed it
1) (What you changed)
2) (How you verified)

## Proof
Paste the output of:
- pwd
- ls -lah
- cd labs/day02 && pwd
- ls -lah
